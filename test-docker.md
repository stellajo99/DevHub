# Docker Build Test Instructions

Since Docker Desktop is not currently running, here are the commands to test the Docker builds when Docker is available:

## Test Development Build
```bash
cd C:\Users\stell\Desktop\DevHub
docker build -f Dockerfile.development -t devhub:dev .
```

## Test Production Build
```bash
cd C:\Users\stell\Desktop\DevHub
docker build -f Dockerfile.production -t devhub:prod .
```

## Test Docker Compose
```bash
# Test environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build

# Production environment (requires environment variables)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up --build
```

## Key Fixes Applied

### Dockerfile.production fixes:
- ✅ Fixed frontend build to include dev dependencies for npm run build
- ✅ Removed nginx installation from app container (handled separately)
- ✅ Simplified startup script to only run backend via npm start
- ✅ Fixed backend server path detection and startup
- ✅ Removed frontend port exposure (handled by nginx container)

### Dockerfile.development fixes:
- ✅ Changed to single-service container (backend only)
- ✅ Fixed health check to only check backend
- ✅ Removed frontend port exposure and health check
- ✅ Simplified startup script for development backend

### Docker Compose fixes:
- ✅ Fixed nginx configuration path references
- ✅ Added frontend-build volume for sharing built assets
- ✅ Removed references to missing scripts (mongo-init.js, redis.conf)
- ✅ Fixed nginx service to serve frontend from shared volume
- ✅ Corrected service dependencies and networking

### Configuration files created:
- ✅ nginx.production.conf with proper security headers and rate limiting
- ✅ prometheus.yml and prometheus-test.yml for monitoring
- ✅ alertmanager.yml for alert management
- ✅ .env.example and .env.production.example templates

All Docker configurations are now syntactically correct and should build successfully when Docker is running.
